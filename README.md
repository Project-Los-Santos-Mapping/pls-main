# 🏙️ Project Los Santos (PLS)
**A community-driven FiveM mapping initiative to give purpose and interiors to as many GTA V buildings as possible.**  
Our mission: transform Los Santos into a fully explorable, immersive city with functional, high-quality interiors for players and developers.



## 🎯 Goals
- Add interiors to unused or empty buildings across Los Santos.
- Improve existing map areas with modern, optimized structures.
- Maintain consistent, lore-friendly designs that fit naturally into GTA V.
- Create an open, collaborative environment for the community.
- Deliver performance-optimized and stable map assets.



## 📦 What Is Included?
- Custom-made MLO interiors  
- Improvements to world geometry  
- Building extensions and renovations  
- Functional gameplay spaces  
- Community-submitted maps and fixes  

> **Every contribution undergoes testing for stability, collisions, performance, and FiveM compatibility.**
