# Contributing to Project Los Santos (PLS)

Thank you for your interest in contributing!  
Project Los Santos is a community-driven effort to add interiors, improve world spaces, and enhance Los Santos in a lore-friendly and optimized way.

This document explains how to contribute maps, fixes, improvements, or suggestions.


## 🏗️ Before You Begin
Please ensure your contribution meets the following goals:

- **Lore-friendly:** Architecturally consistent with GTA V’s world style  
- **Optimized:** No excessive props, 4K textures, or unnecessary poly counts  
- **Functional:** No missing collisions, invalid portals, lighting bugs, or floating props  
- **Compatible:** Tested across various FiveM gamebuilds and artifacts when possible  
- **Non-commercial:** No paid assets or marketplace content may be submitted  

If you need guidance, feel free to join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/bQ8gcXxWWT).


## 📦 What You Can Contribute
You may contribute:

- New MLO interiors  
- Fixes or enhancements to existing PLS interiors  
- Lighting, collision, or prop corrections  
- Exterior building improvements  
- YMAP/YBN/YDR/YFT assets  
- Performance updates  
- Documentation improvements  
- Tools or utilities relevant to mapping


## 🛠 Required Tools
Contributors typically use:

- CodeWalker (latest dev build recommended)  
- Blender with Sollumz  
- 3DS Max (optional)  
- OpenIV  
- FiveM toolchain for testing  
- Any YMAP/YBN/YDR handling tools  

Your workflow may differ, but results should match project standards.


## 🧪 Testing Requirements

Every contribution **must** be tested on:

- **At least two FiveM artifacts** (e.g., 17000)  
- **At least two GTA V gamebuilds** (e.g., b2699, b2944, b3095, b3258)

Testing confirms:

- No performance drops  
- No crashing upon loading  
- No missing textures or invisible geometry  
- Collisions work as expected  
- Lighting behaves correctly (night & day cycles)
